> As Society becomes more complex, as individuals in communities we have less control. As the economic and political chaos of recent years demonstrates, greater technology and affluence does not create satisfaction, it creates a reactionary insecurity, and with that less control, except in the conditions of ever harsher repression. Which is arguably one of the drivers of the drift to the right in the UK over recent years.
>
> People dismiss Zerzan because they perceive what he says as Extreme, nonsensical or to use the phrase I remarked on earlier, unrealistic. The fact is these ideas are presented to us routinely within our everyday culture from news articles about nonsensical computer glitches to dystopian stories, but because this noise does not directly challenge the foundation of modern culture, these events usually pass without reflection.
>
> A brilliant example of this are the Matrix films. For example, there's a wonderful scene in Matrix Reloaded which seemingly passes without note amidst the crescendo of action and violence across the Arc of the storyline. Neo accompanies a council member down to the engineering level: "almost no one comes down here unless of course there's a problem, that's how it is with people nobody cares how it works as long as it works. I like it down here I like to be reminded that this city survives because of these machines, these machines are keeping us alive while other machines are coming to kill us. Interesting isn't it, the power to give life and the power to end it."
>
> Of course the power of Science Fiction is that it can poke ridicule at the everyday frustrations of technological life there in creating a compelling narrative because it speaks to our inner lived experience. Neo then remarks "but we control these machines, they don't control us, if we wanted to we could shut these machines down", to which the counselor replies: "that's control, if we wanted we could smash them to bits, although if we did we'd have to consider what would happen to our lights, our Heat, our air" he then continues "there is so much in this world that I do not understand, see that machine it has something to do with recycling, our water supply. I have absolutely no idea how it works, but I do understand the reason for it to work, I have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do, but I believe there's a reason for that as well. I only hope we can understand that reason before it's too late".
>
> To parody Churchill "never in human history have so many understood so little about the things which influence so much in the course of their everyday lives".
>
> This is a cognitive dissonance which traps the residents of technological Society. In one sense most people are aware that modern existence is increasingly irrational and unsustainable, and yet at the same moment they know that without these processes everything they know to be certain would disappear, and in any case even if they felt a need to enact change their lack of understanding makes anything other than a catastrophic "smash them to bits response impossible".
>
> If the modern environmental movement has failed, it is because it cannot offer a convincing alternative to that system, merely a different form of consumerism. Which is arguably why people will not change. To enact change implies control, and as outlined throughout the Matrix films, control is often an illusion based upon factors we cannot in reality control. The reality of the modern technological world is that very few people actually have enough knowledge or economic power to control and so change the world around them, and those that do, like Tech billionaires, are not necessarily guarding our interests.
>
> My work as a computer activist peaked in the 1990s and then drifted away I refused to accept certain elements of what the modern technological system in particular mobile Communications and social media, required me to do.
>
> For example the debate over the creation of web browser cookies in the 1990s, elicited a large campaign from digital Freedom activists. It was generally ignored by a society and media who just didn't understand the reality of this issue, and yet today those cookies are the basis for the panopticon of digital surveillance that pervades people's lives. Creating it's own fears and controlling outcomes.
>
> Zerzan is not a novel thinker, his skill has been to assimilate thousands of years of commentary on technology in society and express that succinctly within the framework of today's peak of human material existence.
>
> For example, take the statement quoted earlier, "as our plight deepens we glimpse how much must be erased for our Redemption." 2,300 years ago Diogenes of Sinope, is reputed to have said "self-taught poverty is a help towards Philosophy, for the things which philosophy attempts to teach by reasoning, poverty forces us to practice". Even in ancient Greece, the gap between the then height of urban existence, and what was perceived as a natural state of being, was already enough to perceptibly lower the living standards of those wanted to make such a transition.
>
> Now consider that reality today: people know that to create real change, to solve the climate crisis, ecological destruction, or economic inequality, the result would be to live in a society which is, not like this. Given today's reactionary responses from people driven seemingly mad by the pressures Modern Life puts upon them, it is no surprise they wish to cling on to what little they perceive they have.
>
> What Zerzan and other primitivists are calling for is the right to secede from technological Society. Given how comparatively disempowering that choice would appear to render them, why should Society feel so threatened by this?
>
> It is threatening precisely because it highlights, it picks at the common sore, of modern society's instability and meaninglessness. Since the enlightenment swept across Europe, modern thinkers have always looked upon the less developed societies as "Noble Savages." When in fact there is now ample evidence from archeology and anthropology to demonstrate precisely the opposite.
>
> To call for the freedom to return to a more primitive way of living is to attack the core of modernity, or rather, the unequal and destructive set of economic relations which hold people trapped within the confines of industrial society.
>
> In that sense Zerzan's call for a return to a less intensive, non-consumerist, and less developed mode of living, is doubly offensive. Not only because it appears to attack people's access to the modern lifestyle, but also by highlighting the abstract, demonstrably make-believe ideas at its heart, it debases the value of that lifestyle. All religions have problems with unbelievers, but that response is insignificant compared to their visceral hatred of apostates.
